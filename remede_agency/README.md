## Project's presentation

The project is about a new start-up bank, Argent Bank, which is trying to break into the industry and needs help setting up its app. We obtained a two-part contract which is broken down into several phases:

Two phases are defined to initiate the project:
* **Phase 1** 
Phase 1: User Authentication - Creation of a web application allowing customers to log in and manage their accounts and profile.

- Implement in a React application the static HTML/CSS templates provided, then set up user connections' security. It will also be necessary to retrieve basic user's informations via API.


* **Phase 2** 
Phase 2: Transactions - This would be to specify the API endpoints needed for a possible second mission once we have completed the first.

- Make API modeling proposals for the development of the project's second phase (visualization of the month's transactions, details on each transaction, and capability to modify these details). [*Swagger*](https://swagger.io/) is designed to create a .yaml file in order to proceed.

&nbsp;

*Two repositories are needed to enable the project to run:*

1. BACK-END API

Backend Link
<https://github.com/KD-Kongo-Dervilon/P13-Bank-API>

Be noticed this codebase is required in order to use all the functionalities of the front-end application. Make sure not to use the original provided codebase as it is deprecated...
Please refer to the Readme.md documentation provided for installation and use.
### URL/PORT

The default URL used by the micro-API is <http://localhost:3001>.

2. FRONT-END

The present repository contains this part of the project. Any package manager such as npm or yarn is required.

Frontend link
